## Version 3.0.4: 

* Added a few "preset" configurations (color schemes and font colors) 
  rather than having to customize each option manually. 
  This is experimental at this time; will explore the option of 
  allowing users to import a configuration file for this in the future.

* Changed the background page to "about:blank" (instead of mozilla.org) 
  when loading offline pages from the options window.

* Minor bug fix to remove the progress bar which was not being removed 
  in some corner cases.

* Bug fix to correctly load original page when toggling Tranquility mode 
  for an offline page.

* Bug fix to handle loading mixed security content pages correctly

* Bug fix to handle pre-formatted pages correctly
