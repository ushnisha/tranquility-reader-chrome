## Version 3.0.8:

* Ability to run Tranquility Reader on a portion of a webpage 
  by selecting/highlighting only the text that you want to read.

* After highlighting text, right click on the highlighted text 
  and select "Tranquilize Selection!" from the context menu. 

* Ability to create user defined presets (for users who have 
  multiple configurations for Tranquility Reader)

* Changes made to Tranquility Reader preferences are instantly 
  reflected on all tabs in the Tranquil Reading Mode as soon 
  as the modified preferences are saved - this allows for 
  easier testing and tuning of the preferences. 

-------------------------------

## Version 3.0.4: 

* Removed popup menu for the browser action; now, clicking on 
  the Tranquility icon will make the page readable. For the 
  other actions provided through the popup menu, users will have 
  to go to the options page or use the Read Later button after 
  running tranquility.

* Added a few "preset" configurations (color schemes and font colors) 
  rather than having to customize each option manually. 
  This is experimental at this time; will explore the option of 
  allowing users to import a configuration file for this in the future.

* Changed the background page to "about:blank" (instead of mozilla.org) 
  when loading offline pages from the options window.

* Minor bug fix to remove the progress bar which was not being removed 
  in some corner cases.

* Bug fix to correctly load original page when toggling Tranquility mode 
  for an offline page.

* Bug fix to handle loading mixed security content pages correctly

* Bug fix to handle pre-formatted pages correctly
