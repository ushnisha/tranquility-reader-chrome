# Tranquility Reader

Tranquility Reader for Chrome/Chromium is an extension that improves 
the readability of web articles.

Tranquility Reader was originally written for Firefox and has been recently
ported to Chrome/Chromium.

Tranquility removes unnecessary elements in a webpage, and provides
a simple and tranquil reading experience. Similar functionality is
available through Readability or iReader or "Reader Mode" in Firefox.
Please try the built in "Reader Mode" first and then consider
Tranquility Reader only if some of the features available only in
Tranquility Reader are critical for you.

## To use Tranquility Reader, you can:

* Click on the navigation-bar icon to transform the page

## Features:

* Compatible with NoScript

* Save content offline for reading later. The tranquility view is 
  saved locally on your computer

* Ability to export/import the offline content.

* Ability to customize default font, font-size, font color, 
  background color, and width of the reading area (you can use 
  https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp to pick a 
  suitable color code - thanks to user JA for feedback on this)

* Create and manage your own preset configuration of the various 
  options/preferences

* Add/edit notes/annotations to portions of the offline content; 
  collate annotations with context for a summary of all your 
  notes and annotations.

* Unobtrusive Menu at the bottom of the screen (displayed on 
  clicking on the (+) symbol on the bottom right corner of the 
  screen) provides additional features

* Additional links are now available through a "More Links" button 
  in the Menu at the bottom of the screen

* Left clicking on a link in the Tranquility view will also open 
  the link URL in the Tranquility view in the current tab

* Transform only a portion of the webpage by highlighting the text 
  and then running Tranquility (right click context menu 
  option - "Tranquilize Selection".  Available from 3.0.7)


## Differences from Firefox version of Tranquility Reader:

* The Chrome Webstore review process has become more demanding with
  longer review times for certain permissions (like "<all_urls">) due
  to which this permission is no longer requested

* Due to above, when left clicking on a link in the Tranquility view,
  only links within the same domain will be opened in the Tranquility
  view; other webpages will show a red color progress bar to indicate
  that Chrome is disallowing this behaviour.  Clicking a second time
  will open the link without processing it.

* Also, the right click context menu to open a link in a new tab and
  then transform the page into the Tranquility Reader view will also
  not work now (without the "<all_urls>" permission).

* An attempt will be made soon to request the "<all_urls>" permission
  in the next version, but if this is rejected by the Chrome webstore,
  the extension will no longer support this functionality.
